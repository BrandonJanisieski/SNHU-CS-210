The initial project was to create a program that could: Display a count of what items were purchased on a given day when given a list from a .txt file in 3 forms: A basic list which shows a count next to each item purchased, the ability to search for a specific item that was purchased and display the count, and show the count in a text-based histogram.

I thought what I did particularly well was make a simple program that was fairly easy to follow. A very large portion of the code, especially what was written in Python, was re-used and still made for an effective program. It was pretty simple to make and would be easy for someone else to follow and understand.

I think where I could have enhanced the code is the length. I think I could have probably made my Python code a bit shorter. While it is simple, it is still fairly lengthy and repetitive. I felt like I could have condensed it down a lot.

Getting the .txt file into a python list was probably the most challenging part. Once it was in a list, however, it was only a matter of altering what I do with that list in order to complete each individual task I needed to.

I think in general the skills of being able to research what needs to be done (i.e. looking up how others have solved your own problems) is a skill in it's own right, and a valuable one in this field. In general programming is a tool to help automate certain things, and being able to troubleshoot and problem solve with it is important. I think just about every programming project grows that skill and will be useful in developing into a better programmer.

I think by reusing as lot of the code it was made readable, and adaptable. Since each portion of the python code re-uses a lot of the same code, you could alter what you do with the list in order to get difference outputs, for example you could pull the count of multiple items rather than just 1 item. It would be a fairly easy change to make since that part of the code is clearly defined in a def function.
